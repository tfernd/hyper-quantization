# Hyper-Quantization

**Hyper-Quantization** is an experimental project that builds on the quantization techniques of [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). It explores new quantization schemes and techniques to optimize LLM inference performance while maintaining model accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features (Work in Progress)

- Novel quantization types beyond standard integer quantization.
- Optimized quantization schemes.
- Experimentation with new weight compression methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Status
This project is currently **under construction**. Stay tuned for updates.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
(TBD - instructions coming soon)

## ðŸ“„ License
